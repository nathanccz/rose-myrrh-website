			<h2>Welcome to Rose & Myrrh</h2>
			<p>
				Located in the heart of Southern California, Rose & Myrrh reflects the best of SoCal living—laid-back, 
				intentional, and full of flavor. We draw inspiration from the region’s sunlit mornings, farmers’ markets, 
				and diverse culinary roots to craft a space that feels both grounded and transportive.
			</p>

			<h3>Our Story</h3>
			<p>
				Rose & Myrrh began as a weekend ritual—just one baker, one stove, and a growing circle of neighbors hungry 
				for something that felt homemade. What started with cinnamon rolls on Saturdays soon bloomed into a full menu 
				of slow-fermented pastries, floral cakes, and cozy drinks. We’re still baking in small batches and pouring every 
				coffee by hand, the way it all began.
			</p>

			<h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
			<blockquote>"The simplest things—warm bread, soft light, a quiet morning—are often the most sacred."</blockquote>
			<p>
				At Rose & Myrrh, we believe good things take time—dough that rises slowly, flavors that unfold with patience, and 
				spaces that invite you to linger. Our kitchen is built on quiet rituals: hands in flour, water warmed just so, the 
				steady rhythm of care behind every bake. We don’t rush the process because we know the process is the point.
			</p>
			<p>
				We draw inspiration from nature, tradition, and the beauty of the everyday. Whether it’s a simple croissant or a slice 
				of spiced carrot cake, our goal is the same: to offer something real. Something rooted. Something that feels like home, 
				even if it’s your first time walking through the door.
			</p>

			<h4>What Makes Us Special?</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> Nothing mass-produced. Everything we serve is made with care and intention.</li>
